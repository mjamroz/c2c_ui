access_period has a different signification, depending of waypoint_type\n It implies different label/titles/placeholders. And this logic is needed in both document views and\n edition views. So we have to do a mixin for this logic\n\n Placeholders are needed only in edition views, but it's better to keep all thois logic on the same place\n*************************************************************************************************************/\n\nexport default {\n  computed: {\n    descriptionTitle() {\n      return this.document && this.document.waypoint_type === 'access' ?
