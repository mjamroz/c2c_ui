Waypoint fields access and access_period has a different signification, depending of waypoint_type\n It implies different label/titles/placeholders. And this logic is needed in both document views and\n edition views. So we have to do a mixin for this logic\n\n Placeholders are needed only in edition views, but it's better to keep all thois logic on the same place\n*************************************************************************************************************/\n\nexport default {\n    computed: {\n        accessTitle() {\n            if (this.document.waypoint_type === 'access') {\n                return this.$gettext('public transportation access')\n            }\n\n            if (['hut', 'climbing_indoor', 'climbing_outdoor'].includes(this.document.waypoint_type)) {\n                return this.$gettext('pedestrian access')\n            }\n\n            return this.$gettext('road or pedestrian access')\n        },\n\n        accessPeriodTitle() {\n            if (['hut', 'gite', 'camp_site'].includes(this.document.waypoint_type)) {\n                return this.$gettext('opening_periods')\n            }\n\n            if (this.waypoint_type === 'local_product') {\n                return this.$gettext('opening_hours')\n            }\n\n            if (this.waypoint_type === 'climbing_outdoor') {\n                return this.$gettext('restricted_access')\n            }\n\n            return this.$gettext('access_period')\n        },\n\n        descriptionPlaceholder() {\n            let type = this.document ? this.document.waypoint_type : undefined\n\n            if (type === 'access') {\n                return this.$gettext('Describe here the waypoint')\n            }\n\n            return this.$gettext('Describe road access')\n        },\n\n        accessPlaceholder() {\n            let type = this.document ? this.document.waypoint_type : undefined\n\n            if (type === 'access') {\n                return this.$gettext('Describe pt access')\n            }\n\n            if (type === 'hut' || type === 'climbing_indoor' || type === 'climbing_outdoor') {\n                return this.$gettext('Describe pedestrian access')\n            }\n\n            return this.$gettext('Describe access')\n        },\n\n        accessPeriodPlaceholder() {\n            let type = this.document ? this.document.waypoint_type : undefined\n\n            if (type === 'hut' || type === 'gite' || type === 'camp_site') {\n                return this.$gettext('Describe opening periods')\n            }\n\n            if (type === 'local_product') {\n                return this.$gettext('Describe opening hours')\n            }\n\n            if (type === 'climbing_outdoor') {\n                return this.$gettext('Describe access restrictions')\n            }\n\n            return this.$gettext('Describe access period')\n        }\n    }\n}\n","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"control\"},[_c('markdown-editor',{attrs:{\"placeholder\":_vm.placeholder},model:{value:(_vm.value_),callback:function ($$v) {_vm.value_=$$v},expression:\"value_\"}})],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"markdown-editor\",class:{'is-active':_vm.focus, 'fullScreen':_vm.fullScreen}},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"button-bar\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"buttons has-addons is-pulled-right\"},[_c('editor-button',{attrs:{\"icon\":\"question-circle\",\"tooltip\":_vm.$gettext('help'),\"href\":\"https://www.camptocamp.org/articles/151910\",\"target\":\"_blank\"}}),_c('span',[_vm._v(\" \")]),_c('editor-button',{attrs:{\"icon\":_vm.fullScreen ?
